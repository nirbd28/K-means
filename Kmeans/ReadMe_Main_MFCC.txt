Run the code "Main_MFCC" in order to see how the k-means algorithm divides an mfcc matrix of a specific audio file.
There is an option to divide the audio file to phonem sections, in this case you may use the code "SortPhonemesFromFile" or "SortPhonemesUserInput".
There is and audio file in the folder for example and an info text file which contains the end of each phonem (in time).
